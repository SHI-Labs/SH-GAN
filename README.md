## Introduction

</p>

Spectral Hint GAN (**SH-GAN**) is an high-performing inpainting network enpowered by CoModGAN and novel spectral processing techniques. SH-GAN reaches state-of-the-art on FFHQ and Places2 with freeform masks.

## Network and Algorithm

The overall structure of our SH-GAN shows in the following figure:

Heterogeneous Filtering Explaination: 
<p style="font-size:9pt">
<ul>
  <li>1x1 Convolution in Fourier domain leads a uniform (homogeneous) transform from one spectral space to another.</li>
  <li>ReLU in Fourier domain is like a value-dependend band pass filter that zero out some frequency values.</li>
  <li>We promote the **heterogeneous transforms** in spectral space, in which the frequency value transformations are depended on the frequency bands.</li>
</ul>
</p>

Gaussian Split Algorithm Explaination:

Gaussian Split is a spectral space downsampling method that well-suit deep learning structures. A quick intuition is that it likes Wavelet Transform that can pass information in different frequency band to its corresponding resolution.
